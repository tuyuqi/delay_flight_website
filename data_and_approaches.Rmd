# Data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The database - "Airline On-Time Performance Data" used comes from Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), which is a U.S. Department that tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers and details on the causes of flight delays.

# Approaches

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We selected 23 relevant variables and chose time ranges from 2012 Janurary to 2016 December. Our variables of interest fall into three categories based on variable types:`Indicator variables`, `Continuous variables`,`Categorical variables`. What's worth mentioning is that we only regard the flight arrival/departure time exceeding 15 minutes as delay in this project. Out of these variables, we have done statistical analyses on five main causes of delay - `Late Arriving Aircraft Delay(Minutes)`, `Security Delay(Minutes)`, `National Air System Delay(Minutes)`, `Weather Delay(Minutes)`, `Carrier Delay(Minutes)`. The statistical analyses were done
from different perspectives on delay frequency, time patterns, and hypothesis t test.
