&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our result parallels with the article, ‘An Answer to Flight Delays?’ by Tracy Samantha. A significant reason for flight delays breakdowns within the National Aviation System (NAS), which includes airports and the air traffic control centers. National Aviation System delay includes Flow control program, Volume Delays, Airport conditions, Bird strikes, _etc_. Since the NAS delay includes issues of a number of significant and complex factors, when the issues happened, many flights will be affected and might have a delay.\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Carrier delay and Late aircraft delay are major on the delayed flights. Carrier delay includes aircraft cleaning, awaiting gate space, engineering inspection, late minute passenger, removal of unruly passengers, _etc_. To avoid these effects, all airport staffs, crews, and passengers have the responsibility. Late aircraft delay is caused by the same aircraft arrived late which caused the current flight to depart late. The late aircraft delay might also cause more than one delayed flight since the delay might cumulative on the future flights.
