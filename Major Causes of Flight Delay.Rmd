> **5 major** causes:
        
  * Carrier delay
  * Weather delay 
  * National System delay 
  * Security delay 
  * Late aircraft delay 


> **31 combinations** of the major causes of flight delay


how many delayed flight are caused by the combinations of different major causes. Originally, we did not anticipate that NAS delay is the largest cause. After reviewing extra articles, our result parallels with the article, ‘An Answer to Flight Delays?’ by Tracy Samantha. A significant reason for flight delays breakdowns within the National Aviation System (NAS), which includes airports and the air traffic control centers. Since the NAS delay includes issues at the air traffic control centers, the Flow control program, and other significant and complex factors, when the issues happened, a number of flight will be affected and might have delay.
