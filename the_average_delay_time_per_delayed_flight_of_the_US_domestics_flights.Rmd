# Total average delay minutes


* **Delta Air Lines** has the **longest** average delay minutes per flight among the delayed flights (average delay 200.4493 minutes per delayed flight in the sum of all causes). 
 
* Mesa Airlines, ExpressJet Airlines Inc., SkyWest Airlines Inc., and Endeavor Air Inc. also have a high average of delay minutes per flight among the delayed flights. 

* These high average delay time might be caused by some outliers that have extremely large delay minutes and the reason needs to be further investigated. For example, a piece of new showing that “A Delta Flight Was Delayed for 2 Hours Because a Pilot and Flight Attendant Had an Argument” might show a possible example of the outliers. (_www.Fortune.com_).

# Average Security delay

* **Delta Air Lines** is affected **largely** on average security delay. 

* The average delay minutes per delayed flights of Delta Air Lines, caused by security delay, is almost twice of that of other airlines, such as American Airlines, and United Air Lines. 

* _AirTran Airways Corporation_ and _Frontier Airlines Inc._ do not have security delay on the graph, nor the dataset. It might be true that these two airlines barely experience delay due to security within the five years. However, it might not be ideal in the real world. One possible explanation could be that the data might be not recorded in the dataset.

\


# Average National Aviation System delay

* **Virgin America** is affected **largely** on average National Aviation System delay. 
 
* The average delay minutes per delayed flights of Virgin America, caused by NAS delay, is almost twice of that of other airlines, such as Alaska Airlines, and SkyWest Airlines. 

\


# Average weather delay

* Weather delay affects the airlines almost evenly. 
 
* Most of the average delay minutes per delayed flights of different airlines, casued by weather delay, is around 40 minutes. 

* However, _Virgin America_ shows the lowest delay minutes (under 20 minutes) per delayed flight.

\


# Average carrier delay

* **Mesa Airlines** is affected **largely** on average carrier delay . 
 
* The average delay minutes per delayed flights caused by carrier delay mainly fluctuates between 20 minutes to 45 minutes. 

\


# Average late aircraft delay

* Late aircraft delay affects the airlines almost evenly around 40 minutes
 
* However, _Hawaiian Airlines_ shows the lowest delay minutes (under 30 minutes) per delayed flight.
